tftpd
=====

A *really* simple tftp server made for myself.

I only made this for myself, to play a little bit with Golang, it's not
advanced or anything, it's a basic read only server and all the heavy lifting
is done by a third party libs.

So basically, it's parsing some options and using some libs, nothing fancy.
